# What I have Learned

- What is p5.js doing? Well it is creating a server. 

- What this server is doing has relation to "The Cloud"

- ex. Google has a server. When we access google, we are sending a request to the Google Server, and their server is sending us back a response. When we are making our own js webpages on our laptops with p5, that is what is happening too.

- If I want to connect to Twitter with p5, i need to access the server, while p5 is up and also talking to Twitter for me.

- Servers also come in handy when I am saving things to a database on a server.

- The way to access Node.js is with the command line (use a terminal)

- A terminal is sort of like a window to the computer's soul (so you can access what the computer has to offer). You can isssue commands to the computer via the terminal. (ex. pwd = print working directory)(ex. cd = change directory)

- node lets you run arbritary javascript


# Still Don't Know

- How does node access the contents of the terminal? I'm still confused as to how this all connects to each other.

- Why Twitter? Is there anything unique about Twitter? I feel like I will find this out in future videos in this series, but I am leaving it as a question for now.

# Interesting Ideas

- I want to do a project with node and through accessing my terminal, and this project doesn't have to be for computer science but for any class! Now that I know how to use node and the terminal, I could make an interactive webpage for my next class presentation.
